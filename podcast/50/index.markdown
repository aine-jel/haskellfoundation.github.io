In this episode Tom Sydney is chatting with Matti Paul and Niki Vazou. Tom is the author of many tools, like sydtest, decking, and nix-ci. He tells us about the rules for sustainable Haskell, how Haskell lets one man do the job of 50, and the secret sauce for open source.

Tom Sydney is also looking for work these days, so get in touch!
