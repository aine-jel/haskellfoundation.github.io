Victor Miraldo is interviewed by Niki and Joachim and walks us through this career from a student falling in love with List.foldr through a PhD student using agda to verify cryptographic data structures and generic diff and merge algorithms to a professional developer using Haskell in production. Heâ€™ll tell us why the Haskell community is too smart, why there should be a `safePerformIO`, and that he hopes that Software Engineering could be less like alchemy.
