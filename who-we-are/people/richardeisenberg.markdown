[Richard](https://richarde.dev/) has a long track record of contributing to Haskell (GHC, in particular) since 2012, including many publications pushing the boundaries of what Haskell can accomplish. He implemented <tt>-XTypeInType</tt> and <tt>-XTypeApplications</tt>, has done considerable work on the constraint solver, type checker, and core language representations in GHC. He is also the author of singletons, serves on the GHC Steering Committee, and was an early member of the HF working group, driving the development of its initial technical agendas. He has been chair of the Haskell Symposium and Haskell Implementors' Workshop. Richard currently works at Jane Street as a compiler engineer, and enjoys thinking about taking Haskell ideas into OCaml and OCaml ideas into Haskell.
