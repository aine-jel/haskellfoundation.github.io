Jasper encountered Haskell just as he started university, and
was completely smitten by the language. He went on to spent most of
his student days working on various open source Haskell projects.
After graduating, he worked for several companies using Haskell in
production. He then started to contribute to the community, chairing
the Haskell.org foundation and growing ZuriHac into a world-class
event. He currently works in the cloud & software security field.
