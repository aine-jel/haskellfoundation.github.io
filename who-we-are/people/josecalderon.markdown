Jose Calderon's background is split between industrial R&D at Galois, Inc. and Computer Science instruction at the University of Maryland. His research has focused on the implementation of programming languages for privacy-preserving technologies, high-assurance deployments, and the implementation of lazy functional languages. Much of his work leveraged Haskell as the implementation language of choice, though he has used OCaml, Racket, and C professionally. At the University of Maryland Jose taught the Systems Programming, Programming Languages, and Compilers courses.
