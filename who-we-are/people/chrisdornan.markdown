Chris has been interested in Haskell since the early reports and wrote the original Alex package in the 1990s. In the late nineties Chris taught Haskell to undergraduates in UCC (Cork) and in the noughties used Haskell tools to develop key aspects of the ARMv7 architecture. Since 2013 Chris has been chief Engineer for IRIS Connect where he has overseen the development of the new IRIS Connect video platform which makes extensive use of Haskell in the back end.
