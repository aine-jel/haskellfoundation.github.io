title: Haskell.org and the Haskell Foundation Join Forces
---


The members of the Haskell.org Committee (the Committee) and the directors of the Haskell Foundation (the Foundation) are pleased to announce that we have joined forces, with the aim (subject to regulatory approval) of merging Haskell.org, Inc. and Haskell Foundation, Inc. into a single not-for-profit corporation. Together we continue our common mission to advance functional programming and to advocate for the Haskell language, its ecosystem, and its community.
